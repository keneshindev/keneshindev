## Hi there!
I'm Keneshin, nice to meet you! The [old account](https://github.com/Keneshin) was deleted, so I created a new one.  
I'm JavaScript/TypeScript programmer. I also code on C# and C++, but my projects are mostly on JavaScript.   
I also started coding on Kotlin, and writing plugins for [Aliucord](https://github.com/Aliucord). You can see my plugins [here](https://github.com/keneshindev/aliucord-plugins).   
Kotlin is awesome!
