## Hi there!
I'm Keneshin, nice to meet you! I'm 15 years old Software Engineer from Russia.

My focused project that i'm working on: [Kuracord](https://github.com/Kuracord)   
## Some projects you should look at:

Kotori is another Discord API wrapper for bots. Allows selfbotting.
### [SusRPG](https://github.com/keneshindev/SusRPG)

Kuracord.js is discord.js like Kuracord API wrapper, made for creating bots.
### [Kitari](https://github.com/keneshindev/KitariTelegram)
