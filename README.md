## Hi there!
I'm Keneshin, nice to meet you! I'm 15 years old Software Engineer from Russia.   
I love TypeScript and Kotlin.  
## Some projects you should look at:   
### [Kotori](https://github.com/keneshindev/Kotori)
Kotori is another Discord API wrapper for bots. Allows selfbotting.
### [SusRPG](https://github.com/keneshindev/SusRPG)
Simple game, which I meant to be a RPG. It is written fully on HTML, JS and CSS.
### [Kitari](https://github.com/keneshindev/KitariTelegram)
Kitari is a Telegram bot, made with JavaScript. It's name similar with Kotori, lol.
### [PizdOS](https://github.com/keneshindev/PizdOS)
It was my first project, where I used NASM and Make. Abandoned.
